The goal of scLinear is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of scLinear from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DanHanh/scLinear")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```r
library(scLinear)

## get some example data from the Seurat PBMC10K example data set for the tutorial: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/multimodal_vignette.html.
# The download link: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0/pbmc_10k_protein_v3.
# The File: "Feature / cell matrix (raw)"

pbmc10k.data <- Seurat::Read10X(data.dir = "raw_feature_bc_matrix")
rownames(x = pbmc10k.data[["Antibody Capture"]]) <- gsub(pattern = "_[control_]*TotalSeqB", replacement = "", x = rownames(x = pbmc10k.data[["Antibody Capture"]]))
pbmc10k <- Seurat::CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc10k.data[["Gene Expression"]], min.cells = 1, min.features = 1)
pbmc10k[["ADT"]] <- Seurat::CreateAssayObject(pbmc10k.data[["Antibody Capture"]][, colnames(x = pbmc10k)])
Seurat::DefaultAssay(pbmc10k) <- "RNA"

pbmc10k <- prepare_data(pbmc10k, integrate_data = FALSE, annotation_selfCluster = TRUE, remove_empty_droplets = TRUE)

## basic example code

```


```{r}


```



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
